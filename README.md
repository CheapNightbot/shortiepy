## Why

For some reason, when I’m working on things or trying to learn something new, my browser ends up filled with tons of tabs—which makes my laptop-chan angry ~ ₍^.  ̫.^₎

I don’t want to close them or bookmark them. I tried manually copying URLs into a `.txt` file, but then I wished there was a simple way to turn long links into short ones I could use later.

I didn’t want to send anything online, and existing self-hosted URL shorteners felt like overkill for such a small need.

So I made this: a minimal, local-only URL shortener. It started as a single script file and isn’t perfect—but it just works! ~ ദ്ദി/ᐠ｡‸｡ᐟ\


## For Developers

Want to tinker with `shortiepy` or contribute? Here's how to set it up locally:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (keeps things clean!)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install in editable mode (changes reflect instantly!)
pip install -e .
```

Now you can run `shortiepy` from anywhere in your terminal!
Made a change? It’ll work immediately—no reinstall needed!
